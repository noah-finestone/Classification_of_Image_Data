# Classification_of_Image_Data
Developed a high-performance image classification system using a self-implemented Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) on 10,000 MNIST images.

According to the experiments run, the most influential hyperparameters were the activation function, learning rate, epochs, and batch size. Additionally, the experiments show that although MLPs work well for image classification problems, CNNs are much faster and have higher overall accuracy.
