# Image classification using a Multilayer Perceptron
Developed a high-performance image classification system using a self-implemented Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) on 10,000 MNIST images.

Implemented an MLP to classify image data and analysed its performance on a benchmark dataset. Built three MLP models: MLP with no hidden layer, MLP with one hidden layer 128 units and ReLU activations, and MLP with two hidden layers each having 128 units with ReLU activations. All of these models have a softmax layer at the end. Then compared their performance on classifying images in the FASHION-MINST dataset.

According to the experiments run, the most influential hyperparameters were the activation function, learning rate, epochs, and batch size. Additionally, the experiments show that although MLPs work well for image classification problems, CNNs are much faster and have higher overall accuracy.
